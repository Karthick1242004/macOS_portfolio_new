# Steps to Install

To set up the project, run the following commands:

npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm install --force
npm list react react-dom
npm install react@18 react-dom@18


React version may give error while deploying, so better run 
npm run build 
then upload the dist folder in the hosting service.
